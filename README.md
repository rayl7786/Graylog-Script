# Graylog-Script
Python with shell script to install Graylog 2.3 with Elasticsearch 5.X. Currently only tested on Ubuntu 17.10 64-bit but feedback on script would be awesome as I am learning more advanced python techniques.


**With Elasticsearch installed locally, server must have at least 4G of RAM
